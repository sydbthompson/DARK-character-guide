             <p class="card-text"><h4>Jonas Kahnwald</h4>In this season Jonas is seen as both 2019 Jonas and 2052 Jonas, also refered to as "The Stranger". Now in post-apocalyptic Winden, 2019 Jonas lives in his parents house to avoid Elisabeth's cult-like apocalypse gang. Traveling back through the time portal inside the post-apocalypse nuclear power plant, Jonas goes to 1921 where he meets a young Noah who then takes him to Adam. After Adam reveals that he is in fact Jonas aged 60 years in the future, Adam convinces Jonas to go back to 2019 on the day Mikkel disappears. Jonas there meets older Claudia who tells him "some things shouldn't be undone". Jonas then goes to the time and place where Mikkel disappears, finds Mikkel when he breaks off from the group, and leads 2019 Mikkel into the Winden caves to 1986, leaving him there. Jonas spends a year learning about time travel from old Claudia. The day before the apocalypse Jonas finds Martha to save her but Adam appears and kills Martha, claiming Jonas will understand why it was necessary later. Holding Martha's dead body, suddenly a different looking Martha appears and takes Jonas to her alternate reality.</p>

Martha breaks up with Bartosz in 2020 because she is in love with Jonas, eventhough Jonas has now gone missing. In the summer Martha, Magnus, Franziska and Elisabeth run into Bartosz carrying a time-travel device and Bartosz takes them to 1987 as proof where he then tells the group that Noah predicted Jonas' return to Winden. Later at the Nielsen house Martha meets The Stranger or older Jonas where they share a moment when he tells her his identity. Katharina interrupts and reveals that Jonas is her nephew. Older Jonas then traps Martha in the bunker in an attempt to save her from the apocalypse but she escapes and finds 2020 Jonas in the Kahnwald house. They kiss, but then Adam appears and shoots Martha dead, leaving Jonas completely distraught. </p>

Befriending Regina and in need of work under his new identity, Regina's mother Claudia agrees to give Aleksander a secret job to seal the yellow barrels of nuclear waste in the Winden caves so nobody will find them. This agreement is binding between the two, as Claudia and Aleksander are now the only ones to know about the yellow barrels, and Claudia is the only one that knows that Aleksander is not who he says he is and has deep secrets he cannot tell. Aleksander grows up, marries Regina Tiedemann taking her last name to futher avoid suspicion over his made up name, and takes over Claudia's job as head of the power plant. In 2020, an external investigator Clausen approaches Aleksander and arrests him on suspicion of identity misuse.
